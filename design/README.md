**Directory Explanation:**

- `finished_elements`: This folder contains all the completed design files, including final versions of the logo, website UI, and SVG drawings.
- `work_in_progress`: This folder contains design files that are still being worked on.
- `svg_drawings`: This folder contains all the SVG drawings, both full and broken down into components.
  - `full_svgs`: This subfolder contains the full SVG files for the drawings that are to be animated.
  - `component_svgs`: This subfolder contains the SVGs of each component of the larger drawings, broken down for individual animations.

# Design Directory Structure

This directory contains the design assets for the web application, including logos, UI designs, and SVG drawings. Below is a detailed explanation of what each sub-directory contains:

- `finished_elements`: This directory contains all the finalized design elements for the project. Once a design is complete and approved, it should be moved to this folder.

- `work_in_progress`: This directory is for design elements that are still in the process of being worked on. If a design is not yet finalized, it should reside here.

- `svg_drawings`: This directory is for SVG drawings that will be used in the web application.

  - `full_svgs`: This sub-directory contains the complete SVG files for each drawing. These drawings are intended to be animated as a whole.

  - `component_svgs`: This sub-directory contains individual SVG components of larger drawings. These are broken down to allow for more granular control during animation, faster load times, and potential reusability.

Designers should regularly update their work in these folders and ensure that file naming conventions are consistently applied for easy identification and retrieval. The developers will access the necessary files from these directories for implementation in the web application.

For file naming, we suggest a descriptive yet concise approach. For instance, a SVG of a graph for the homepage could be named `home_page_graph.svg` and if it is broken into components, they could be named `home_page_graph_component1.svg`, `home_page_graph_component2.svg`, etc.
